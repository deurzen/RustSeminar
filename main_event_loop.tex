\section{Main Event Loop}

The main event loop in both \wmrs and \wmcpp comprises three core stages. They
first rely on the underlying windowing system to report certain \textit{events}
they are interested in. This is done synchronously, as without any hardware
interrupts or changes to the environment, nothing is to be done. That is,
both window managers \textit{block} until a new event is received. The second
stage is the \textit{extraction} and \textit{bundling} of useful information
from underlying windowing system events into a structure that can be consumed
by the various components of each window manager. The last stage is using
that windowing system event information to perform window management actions,
\textit{delegating work} to different parts of the program.

\rscppsubsection{Windowing System Event Decoupling}

As seen in the examples from the previous section, \wmrs and \wmcpp stipulate
the existence of a \ttt{step} method in their respective \ttt{Connection}
interfaces. This method is responsible for converting underlying windowing
system information into a higher-level event, as can be gleaned from their
signatures: \rsin{fn step(&self) -> Option<Event>} (\wmrs) and \cppin{Event
step()} (\wmcpp). In both cases, \ttt{Event} is some internally defined
structure of data that decouples low-level windowing system event specifics from
that which is consumed at the higher level.

\rssubsection{Internal Event Structuring using Enumerations}

% https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-00-enums.html

To structure event data, \wmrs uses Rust \textit{enumerations}. A Rust
\rsin{enum} allows for the definition of a type by enumerating its variants,
and, aside from encoding \textit{meaning}, is also able to encapsulate
\textit{data}\cite{therustbook}. A small part of \wmrs's \rsin{Event}
\rsin{enum} looks as follows.

\begin{rustblock}
  pub enum Event {
    Mouse { event: MouseEvent },
    Key { event: KeyEvent },
    FocusRequest { window: Window },
    CloseRequest { window: Window },
    ScreenChange,
    // ...
  }
\end{rustblock}

The first four variants are what are known as \textit{struct-like} variants
with named fields, whereas the last one is a fieldless variant that comprises
only an identifier\cite{therustreference}. Behind the scenes, each \rsin{enum}
instance has an associated integer that is used to determine the underlying
concrete variant, known as a \textit{discriminant}\cite{therustreference}.
As such, Rust \rsin{enum}s are \textit{tagged unions}, where the tag is the
discriminant. This also means that the size of each instance of an \rsin{enum}
is determined by that \rsin{enum}'s largest variant. Rust's \textit{default
representation} stores the discriminant as an \rsin{isize}, although the
compiler is free to make use of a smaller type if the amount of variants permits
it\cite{therustreference}.

\cppsubsection{Internal Event Encoding with std::variant}

A similar construct in \cpp is not \textit{its} \cppin{enum} (or \cppin{enum
class}), but rather \cppin{std::variant}, a class template available since
\ttt{C++17} that represents a type-safe tagged union\cite{cppstd}. Just as with
Rust's \rsin{enum}, and similar to regular unions, the object representation
of the concrete alternative held inside a \cppin{std::variant} instance is
allocated entirely within that instance's object representation\cite{cppstd}.
That is, the alternative may not allocate any additional dynamic
memory\cite{cppstd}. As a result, as with Rust's \rsin{enum}, the
size of a \cppin{std::variant} instance is dependent on its largest
alternative\cite{cppstd}. \wmcpp partly represents its \cppin{Event} type as
follows.

\begin{cppblock}
  typedef std::variant<
    std::monostate,
    Mouse,
    Key,
    FocusRequest,
    CloseRequest,
    ScreenChange,
    // ...
  > Event;
\end{cppblock}

Here, each concrete alternative is a \cpp \cppin{struct} containing information
about the specific event that is being represented (e.g. \cppin{struct Mouse}
\cppin{{ MouseEvent event; }};). This is similar to what \wmrs does with its
Rust \rsin{enum}s, only more verbose, non-inlined (as \cppin{std::variant}
cannot deal with anonymous \cppin{struct}s, since \cpp does not have pattern
matching), and therefore less structured and more tedious to work with.

\subsection{Internal Events: Remarks}

An astute reader may have noticed that the \ttt{Connection} interfaces of
\wmrs and \wmcpp do not exactly match. In particular, their respective
\ttt{step} functions' signatures seem to communicate different things. In
\wmrs, that function \textit{optionally} yields an \rsin{Event}, wheres
in \wmcpp, it simply returns an \cppin{Event}. In \cpp, when using a
\cppin{std::variant}, it is encouraged to encode an empty alternative using
\cppin{std::monostate}\cite{cppstd}. The same behavior \textit{could} instead
have been encoded as \cppin{std::option<Event>}, where in this case, the first
alternative of \cppin{Event} is omitted. The difference in usage mainly lies in
the \textit{visiting} of \cppin{Event} alternatives, which we will discuss in
the next section.

\rssubsection{Event Dispatch through Pattern Matching}

Once an event has been generated at the windowing system and filtered into a
structure that is to be consumed by the window manager, work must be delegated
to various handlers that deal with specific types of events. An \ttt{Event}
consequently encodes not only the \textit{information} used by these handlers,
but also which handler is responsible for that event. \wmrs uses Rust's
principle pattern matching construct, \rsin{match}, for event dispatch. Its main
event loop, defined within a method belonging to its \ttt{Model} structure,
partly looks as follows.

\begin{rustblock}
  while self.running {
    if let Some(event) = self.conn.step() {
      match event {
        Event::Mouse { event, }
          => self.handle_mouse(event, /*...*/),
        Event::Key { keycode, }
          => self.handle_key(keycode, /*...*/),
        Event::FocusRequest { window, }
          => self.handle_focus_request(window),
        Event::CloseRequest { window, }
          => self.handle_close_request(window),
        Event::ScreenChange
          => self.handle_screen_change(),
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
\end{rustblock}

The \ttt{step} method returns an \rsin{Option<Event>}, so the first thing to do
is check whether a valid \ttt{Event} was retrieved from the windowing system
connection (i.e., whether the event that was generated is one the window manager
is interested in). Rust's \rsin{if let} construct is syntactic sugar for a
match statement that runs code when the value matches one specific pattern, and
ignores all other values\cite{therustbook}. Converting the above \rsin{if let}
to an equivalent \rsin{match} results in the following.

\begin{rustblock}
  match self.conn.step() {
    Some(event) => { /*...*/ },
    _ => (),
  }
\end{rustblock}

Within the body of the first match \textit{arm}, the \ttt{event} identifier has
been \textit{bound} to the value that was passed in, \textit{if} that value
matches the pattern\cite{therustbook}. Here, that means that \textit{if} a
valid event is returned from the \ttt{step} method, that concrete \ttt{Event}
instance will be bound to the \ttt{event} identifier within the body of
that match arm. The \ttt{\_} placeholder is used to denote all possible
\textit{remaining} values\cite{therustbook}. The Rust compiler will assert
that all possible cases are handled within a match statement, as matches are
exhaustive\cite{therustbook}.

Additionally matching on this \ttt{event}, all \textit{variants} that can
possibly exist for its type are enumerated, binding identifiers to each of
the fields in the struct-like variants defined in the \ttt{Event} enum, which
are then passed on to handler methods within the \ttt{Model} (e.g. \rsin{fn
handle_focus_request(window: Window)}).

\cppsubsection{Delegation by Visiting std::variant Alternatives}

\cpp does not consist of a similar pattern matching construct. Its
\cppin{switch} statement merely allows an identifier to be tested for
\textit{equality} against a list of values. Specifically, that means that
\cppin{std::variant} alternatives cannot simply be \cppin{switch}ed on.
Instead, the \cppin{std::visit} companion function exists to allow for the
\textit{visiting}\cite{go4} of a \cppin{std::variant} instance based on its
possible alternatives\cite{stdvisitwrong, cppstd}. It takes a \textit{visitor}
object that implements \textit{function-call operator} overloads for each of the
alternatives' types, along with the \cppin{std::variant} instance to visit. An
example visitor for the \ttt{Event} variant, defined within \wmcpp's \ttt{Model}
class, partly looks as follows.

\begin{cppblock}
  // ...
  class Model;
  class Model final
  {
  public:
    // ...
  private:
    // ...
    struct EventVisitor
    {
      EventVisitor(Model& model): model(model) {}

      void operator()(std::monostate) {}
      void operator()(Mouse event) {
        model.handle_mouse(event);
      }
      void operator()(Key event) {
        model.handle_key(event);
      }
      void operator()(FocusRequest event) {
        model.handle_focus_request(event);
      }
      void operator()(CloseRequest event) {
        model.handle_close_request(event);
      }
      void operator()(ScreenChange event) {
        model.handle_screen_change(event);
      }
      // ...
    private:
      Model& model;
    } event_visitor = EventVisitor(*this);
    // ...
  };
\end{cppblock}

Whereas \wmrs explicitly assured that a valid event was received, \wmcpp
\textit{implicitly} does so through its \cppin{event_visitor}. The
\cppin{std::monostate} variant represents the \textit{no valid event} case, and
is analogous to a \textit{no-op} event. Within the same class, a method exists
that contains \mbox{\wmcpp}'s main event loop, which roughly does the following.

\begin{cppblock}
  while (running)
    std::visit(event_visitor, conn.step());
\end{cppblock}

Here, we rely on the visitor to deduce the type of the event retrieved from the
underlying connection's \cppin{step} method, subsequently delegating work to the
relevant handler within \wmcpp's model.

\subsection{Event Dispatch: Remarks}

While in this example both \wmrs and \wmcpp are able to express the desired
behavior with relatively little code, visiting tagged union variants in \cpp is
clearly more verbose and less able in communicating intent than in Rust, and
the discrepancies only worsen as more complex (or \textit{pattern-reliant})
situations arise\cite{stdvisitwrong}.
