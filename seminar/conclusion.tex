\section{Conclusion}

We have compared Rust and \cpp in their pragmatics when writing medium to
large system software. Specifically, we have sought to achieve \textit{the
same objective} using both languages: the implementating of a window manager.
In doing so, we have discussed four core phases in the implementation of
such software: external dependency management, the main event loop and event
dispatch, input bindings and the storage of callable objects, and, finally, the
central storage and distributed mutating of state.

Even though Rust is able to make certain guarantees in regard to memory safety and data races, it is still often able to capture more concisely and elegently the semantics
